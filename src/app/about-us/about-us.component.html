<h3>About Us</h3>

<p>
  The Jacksonville Community Band is an all-volunteer, non-profit organization created to share the gift of music with
  the
  entire community. The bandâ€™s musicians come from all walks of life and are drawn together by the common bond of
  musical
  appreciation and performance that only participation in a traditional Concert Band can provide. Founded in 1998 by the
  late Dr. William "Bill" Moffit, the band continues to provide musical entertainment for the Greater Jacksonville
  metropolitan and surrounding areas and gives amateur musicians an outlet through which to perform and a fantastic
  place to make friends. The band is under the co-direction of Mr. Reginald Johnson and Mr. Jerry Carter. Both are well
  respected musicians and instructors in the Duval County School system, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Carter are alumnus of
  Bethune-Cookman College of Music . Mr. Carter earned his Master's degree in Music Education from Jacksonville
  University. Mr Johnson and Mr Carter's background in music has given the band the opportunity to perform a vast
  repertoire of pieces that are both enjoyable and challenging to play. From marches to patriotic arrangements to
  concert band adaptations of classic masterpieces, the musicians of the Jacksonville Community Band have performed
  virtually every genre of music imaginable
  at venues all across the First Coast!
