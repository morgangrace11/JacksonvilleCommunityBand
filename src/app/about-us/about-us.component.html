  The Jacksonville Community Band is an all-volunteer, non-profit organization created to share the gift of music with
  the
  entire community. The bandâ€™s musicians come from all walks of life and are drawn together by the common bond of
  musical
  appreciation and performance that only participation in a traditional Concert Band can provide.

<p>
  Founded in 1998 by the late <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Moffit">Dr. William "Bill"
    Moffit</a>, the
  band continues to provide musical entertainment for the
  Greater Jacksonville metropolitan and surrounding areas and gives amateur musicians an outlet through which to perform
  and a fantastic place to make friends.

  The band is under the co-direction of Mr. Reginald Johnson and Mr. Jerry Carter. Both are well respected musicians and
  instructors in the Duval County School system, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Carter are alumnus of <a target="_blank"
    href="http://www.vandercook.edu/">Bethune-Cookman College of Music</a>. Mr. Carter earned his Master's degree in
  Music Education from Jacksonville University. Mr. Johnson and Mr. Carter's background in music has given the band the
  opportunity to perform a vast repertoire of pieces that are both enjoyable and challenging to play. From marches to
  patriotic arrangements to concert band adaptations of classic masterpieces, the musicians of the Jacksonville
  Community Band have performed virtually every genre of music imaginable at venues all across the First Coast!
